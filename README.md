# Multi-Terrain Mobile Robot - Hexapod Rover Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an autonomous hexapod rover capable of navigating a wide variety of terrains. Equipped with both wheels and legs, as well as potential flying capability, the rover is designed to capture images of wildlife, flora, and geological features, collect environmental samples, and contribute to scientific research in diverse fields such as environmental monitoring, geological surveys, and wildlife studies.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Locomotion System**  
  The rover utilizes an adaptive system for movement, switching between wheels, legs, and flying mode based on terrain conditions.
  - **Wheels**: Energy-efficient movement on flat or slightly uneven surfaces. (Priority)
  - **Legs**: Activated for overcoming obstacles that the wheels can't navigate. (Priority)
  - **Flying Mode**: Deployed when neither wheels nor legs can move the rover over challenging terrain or across gaps. (Conceptual, shall be implemented if time permits)
  - **Climbing mode**: Deployed when neither wheels nor legs can move the rover over challenging terrain (Conceptual, shall be implemented if time permits)

- **Computer Vision & Autonomous Navigation**  
  The rover employs computer vision systems for real-time terrain analysis, allowing it to decide when to switch between locomotion modes and to navigate autonomously. Its AI capabilities reduce the need for human intervention in remote or hard-to-reach locations.

- **Sample Collection and Environmental Monitoring**  
  Sensors and tools collect environmental data (e.g., humidity, temperature) and physical samples. The data is analyzed and shared with a dedicated mobile or web-based app for real-time insights.

- **Remote and Autonomous Control**  
  Users can operate the rover manually via a web-based control dashboard or set it to run autonomously, depending on the mission's needs.

## Applications

- **Geological Surveys**: Analyzing and exploring diverse geological formations.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Collecting real-time data on environmental conditions.
- **Wildlife Studies**: Observing wildlife with minimal disturbance.
- **Disaster Response**: Reaching areas inaccessible to traditional robots.
