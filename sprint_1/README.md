# Hexapod Rover Project - Sprint 1


### Sprint 1 Objectives
During Sprint 1, our primary focus is on planning and preparing for the development process. The tasks in this sprint include defining the technology stack, identifying software-related purchases within the budget, planning features, and creating a preliminary MVP wireframe and design.

## Sprint 1 To-Do List

1. **Decide on the Tech Stack**
   - Research and select the technology stack for the software development of the hexapod project. This includes:
     - Frameworks
     - Development tools
     - Libraries and APIs
   - Finalize decisions and document the stack in this repository for future reference.

2. **Required Software Purchases (Within Budget)**
   - Review project budget and allocate funds for any necessary software purchases such as:
     - Development environments
     - Sensor control software
     - Subscription services (e.g., cloud storage, API access)
   - List and approve all purchases required in this sprint.

3. **Plan Features**
   - Collaboratively brainstorm and outline the key features for the hexapod rover, such as:
     - Autonomy (pathfinding, obstacle avoidance)
     - Data collection (sensor integration, telemetry)
     - Remote control and monitoring
     - Diagnostics and maintenance alerts
   - Prioritize features for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and further development phases.

4. **Wireframe & Design Preliminary MVP**
   - Create wireframes for the MVP’s user interface and control systems (both physical and software-based).
   - Plan the design and layout of the rover’s control interface.
   - Document the wireframes and design approach for review and feedback.
