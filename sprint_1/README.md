# Litter-Picking and Disposal Robot Project - Sprint 1

### Sprint 1 Objectives
In Sprint 1, our primary focus is on software planning and initial development steps. This includes defining the technology stack, identifying software purchases within the budget, planning features, and developing an MVP for testing the litter detection model. For testing purposes, we will focus on training and validating the model through a simple Streamlit app that takes individual photos rather than live video streaming.

## Sprint 1 To-Do List

1. **Decide on the Tech Stack**
   - Research and select the technology stack for the software development of the litter-picking robot project, including:
     - Frameworks
     - Development tools
     - Libraries and APIs (e.g., YOLOv8 for object detection, FastAPI for future streaming capabilities)
   - Finalize decisions and document the stack in this repository for reference in future sprints.

2. **Required Software Purchases (Within Budget)**
   - Review the project budget and allocate funds for necessary software purchases such as:
     - Model training tools
     - Cloud storage or compute services for model training, if required
     - Subscription services (e.g., API access for additional vision models or resources)
   - List and approve all required purchases for this sprint.

3. **Plan Features**
   - Collaboratively brainstorm and outline the key features for the litter-picking robot, including:
     - Object detection (identifying and categorizing litter)
     - Navigation (pathfinding, obstacle avoidance for future sprints)
     - Litter collection and disposal mechanisms
     - Basic telemetry (e.g., battery status)
   - Prioritize features for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and future development phases.

4. **Train and Test Litter Detection Model**
   - Begin training the YOLOv8 model on a dataset of common litter items, aiming for accurate recognition of objects such as bottles, cans, and small bags.
   - Implement a basic Streamlit app to test the model. This app will allow the user to upload photos, which the model will analyze to detect and identify litter. The app provides a preliminary interface for assessing detection accuracy before integrating live video.

5. **Wireframe & Design Preliminary MVP**
   - Create wireframes for the MVP’s user interface, focusing on the Streamlit app for model testing.
   - Plan the design and layout of the robot’s control interface for future live streaming.
   - Document the wireframes and design approach for review and feedback.
